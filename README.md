# Network_port_monitor
This repository contains a simple C# port monitor using System.Net.NetworkInformation.

To work, you need to select the protocol (TCP or UDP), then, if TCP was selected, you need to specify in the filter the ports with which statuses we will look at.

The first column contains: the port number, then the local address, then the remote address, and the last column shows the status.

You can upload the data to a text file by clicking the orange button.

At the very bottom, you can see: the application running time (in milliseconds), the number of scanned ports, and the scan date.

Comments and data on the Windows form are written in Russian. The data on the right can be changed.
